### Development

To work on this component, install [polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve), use bower to install the dependencies and then run:

```
polyserve
```

This will bring up a web server that serves the files as if this component was in a `bower_components` folder. This allows to keep the relative paths for the imports and be able to work in dev.
